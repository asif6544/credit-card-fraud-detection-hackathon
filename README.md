# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection System
## 🏆 IILM University Hackathon Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Credit Card Fraud Detection System** is a machine learning-based classification project developed during a Hackathon at **IILM University**.

Credit card fraud is one of the most serious challenges in the financial industry. Fraudulent transactions represent a very small percentage of total transactions, making fraud detection a highly imbalanced and complex problem.

This project aims to build an intelligent system that can identify fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently using machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions process millions of transactions every day. Among these, fraudulent transactions are rare but cause significant financial losses.

### Challenges:
- Highly imbalanced dataset (very few fraud cases)
- Need for high recall to detect fraudulent transactions
- Avoiding false positives to prevent customer inconvenience
- Real-time fraud detection requirement

The goal of this project is to build a robust classification model capable of detecting fraud with high precision and recall.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Our team developed a fraud detection system that:

- Preprocesses transaction data
- Handles imbalanced datasets using stratified train-test splitting
- Applies feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Implements classification algorithms
- Compares model performance
- Evaluates results using advanced performance metrics

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
- **Development Environment:** VS Code  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Implemented

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

Both models were trained and evaluated to determine the best performing model for fraud detection.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

To ensure reliability and effectiveness, the following metrics were used:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

Special focus was given to **Recall**, since detecting fraudulent transactions is more critical than minimizing false alarms.

## 📈 Key Features of the Project

- Imbalanced dataset handling
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Stratified train-test splitting
- Model comparison and performance evaluation
- Visual confusion matrix representation
- Clean and modular code structure
